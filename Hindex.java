/*S30 FAANG Problem #117 {Medium} - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP9SdQV2HR0
    
    For an array of citations of a researcher, Compute the researcher's h-index.
    H index can be defined as: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

    Example:
    Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
                 received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
                 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
                 two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
    Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
