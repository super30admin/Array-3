"""
Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/
Approach: Using Reverse, In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest nâˆ’k elements gives us the required result.

Time complexity: O(n). nn elements are reversed a total of three times.
Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.
