# H-Index

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of papers (length of the citations array). 
However, it only requires O(1) extra space for variables.

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort()  # Sort the citations array in non-decreasing order
        n = len(citations)
        h_index = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted array from the end
        for i in range(n):
            # Compare the citation count with the number of papers
            # that have received at least that many citations
            if citations[i] >= n - i:
                h_index = max(h_index, n - i)  # Update h-index
                
        return h_index
